# Bank-Marketing

## Motivation:

The idea behind this project is to build a model and balance the training dataset as there is an imbalance in the dataset obtained. We have compare the performance of these models and how long each of them would take.

## Methodology:

We have performed various data pre processing steps to preprare the dataset for the models. We have then tested out 3 different models - Kernel SVM, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks and compare the performance.

## Results

Compared the performance of multiple classification models like SVM, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks using f1-score as an evaluation metric.
Performed Hyper-Parameter tuning using GridSearchCV and selected SVM model which achieved an accuracy of 0.88 and a f1-score of 0.45.
